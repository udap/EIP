/**

packet of some fungible tokens of the same type and of the same owner.

Conceptually it's similar to a mini-wallet containing a single type of cash. The wallet can be used
to buy other tokens; or it can be split to two wallets. Two wallets of the same type and ownership can be
merged together to become a wallet of larger denomination. A wallet can also transfer some of its
denominations to another wallet of the same currency type regardless of the owner.

IDebit makes some fungible tokens a single unit of value that can participate in trading.
